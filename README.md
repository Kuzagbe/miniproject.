To have a better understanding of what I did, the link below contains the low fidelity
prototype and high fidelity prototype and also a YouTube Video of how I interacted with 
UI design for the high fidelity. This is on InVision...

 ##RESOURCES USED
 NOTE: Even though I had inspiration from a YouTube video I wanted to explore more so...
 1) In the main dart file i decided to use the themeData to share colors and font style but I didn't use it  through
 because I wanted to touch on what was taught in class which is using the background color components.
 
 2) Also instead of using Icon alone I decided to import svg file from the net and use the two. The 
 svg files were used in for the topNavigation bar and some of the cart file.
